#NYT React Search App

## Overview
This is a single page app that allows users to use a search form to find articles in the New York Times article API. Users input key word(s) plus the start and end year to search between and the API will return the top 10 articles that meet the criteria.

The results will display along with options to read each artcle (links to the NYT article) or save the article to our database (this will also move the article to the Saved Articles section of the page).

The Saved Articles section of the page shows the same article detail (headline, publication date/time, and Read button) as the Results display, as well as a button to delete the article, which will remove the article from the page (and our database).
